# Machine to machine (M2M) communication using <br>Azure Active Directory

This example shows:
* how to configure an API to require access tokens issued by Azure Active Directory
* how to obtain access tokens for a confidential client (meaning an application that is
  able to handle secrets), as a background worker or daemon, without user interaction

`server.py` contains the server definition that requires and validates access tokens.
`client_using_secret.py` contains a client definition that, using [MSAL for Python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python), obtains access
tokens using the `client credentials flow` **with a secret**, and calls the server.

`client_using_certificate.py` contains a client definition that, using [MSAL for Python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python), obtains access
tokens using the `client credentials flow` **with a certificate**, and calls the server.
Refer to the information under `certs` folder to have a reference on how to generate valid
certificates for Azure Active Directory.

`client_http_example.py` shows an example using the client credentials flow
with secret can with HTTP, without using MSAL for Python.

The following scheme describes the flow of this example.

* Client is the application running as daemon, connecting to the API
* AAD is Azure Active Directory
* API is the web application exposing an API and requiring access tokens

## How to run this example

To run the example using the secret:

1. configure app registrations in a Azure Active Directory tenant
2. create a `.env` file with appropriate values, like in the example below,
   or in alternative, configure the environmental variables as in the same
   example
3. create a Python virtual environment, install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`
4. activate the virtual environment in two terminals, then:
5. run the server in one terminal `python server.py`
6. run the client file in another terminal `python client_using_secret.py`

> ⚠️ **Attention** the example `server.py` works well under Unix, there is a
> performance issue when it is run on Windows. **The client part works well**.
> Please use WSL on Windows, to run this example without experiencing the
> performance issue (the issue is under investigation).

The client file should display that an access token is obtained successfully
from Azure Active Directory and a call to the running server was successful.

`http_example.py` shows an example of how the client credentials flow with secret can be
used with HTTP, without using MSAL for Python.

## Example .env file

To configure application settings to run these examples, create an `.env` file
with contents like in the following block:

```bash
# Server configuration
API_ISSUER="https://sts.windows.net/<YOUR_TENANT_ID>/"
API_AUDIENCE="<YOUR_API_AUDIENCE_OR_CLIENT_ID>"

# Client configuration
AAD_AUTHORITY="https://login.microsoftonline.com/<YOUR_TENANT_ID>/"
APP_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_CLIENT_APP_CLIENT_ID>"
APP_CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR_CLIENT_APP_SECRET>"
APP_CLIENT_SCOPE="<YOUR_API_APP_CLIENT_ID>/.default"

# For the example using a certificate:
APP_CLIENT_CERT_THUMBPRINT="<YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT>"
```

The `.env` file is read using `python-dotenv` when the examples are run.
